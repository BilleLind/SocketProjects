# SocketProjects
this is my project for all my Socket projects, so it is easy to find and go through all of them at a later point
so far i have made:
- a Loan calculator in the server which returns the calculated data to the client
- A Capatilaze client server 
- A simple server date server that returns a date and time to a client
- A "ClientBasic" & "ServerBasic" that we used to test connection with 2 different laptops over a wifi hotspot
- A Java client that is to be connected to a Python3 server on a raspberry pi. it send for a temp and humidity at a interval
- A tictactoe client and server. 


- et fælles project med en Raspberry pi server som aflæser humidity og temperatur, det er skrevet i Python3
Servern sender det til Java når client anmoder om det
